          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I conducted user interviews to better understand the audience of our product before beginning to design.
There were five main goals for this research:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Understand how users currently approach new recipes or techniques, what drives them to attempt new recipes</li>
  <li> Understand what resources the users currently turn to when faced with a problem in their current cooking and baking</li>
  <li>Understand the impact of something going wrong in a recipe impacts their motivation and willingness to continue to learn</li>
  <li>Understand what potential pain points would need to be avoided in order to ensure engagement is maintained</li>
  <li>Understand the usersâ€™ expectations given that they will be paying for the service</li>
</ol>
<p>I interviewed four people remotely and found that there was significant diversity in their approach to problem-solving, but strong alignment in both expectations of the experts and what features would be required to justify charging for the service. </p>
<p>The key expectations of the experts were that they are easily able to communicate with and are approachable as well as have a broad knowledge of different ingredients and cuisines. They need to have experience working with the types of equipment that a home cook is likely to use.</p>
<p>The users highlighted that a subscription service would make them more likely to use the service, as they were already financially committed, however, this does raise the need to ensure the experience is good from the first interaction.</p>
<p>All the users highlighted visual learning as a style, so the quality of video and images is key. They were more likely to seek out help via google or contacting a person they trust for help in recipes rather than asking an expert. I need to either provide an experience that replaces this through easy access to information or ensure that usability is so strong that speaking to the expert becomes the easier option and trumps familiarity.</p>

          <h2>User Personas</h2>
          <p>I created three different personas to ensure that I was mindful of a diverse set of needs and viewpoints when designing our product.</p>
