    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I am a resilient person who is passionate about making a change in society and meeting new challenges. I am ambitious by nature and do have a strong sense of competition. I enjoy new experiences and actively seek out opportunities to grow. I am curious by nature and consistently work to find creative solutions for problems. II thrive in a collaborative environment where innovation and new ideas can be debated and implemented.
</p><p>I have worked in customer experience and customer success for the past eight years with six of them being in management. This has given me significant exposure to different customers, how they think and how to find out what they are looking for. I have also mentored junior members of my various teams and this coupled with my leadership experience makes me a strong advocate for the customer. My experience is in the financial services and tech industries. </p>
